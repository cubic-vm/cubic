## How to create a good pull request?

High quality pull requests are easier to review and thus take less of your and our time.

General guideline:
- Each pull request must have exactly one intend (fix a bug, update doc, etc.).
- Each pull request should have one Git commit (not mandatory, but recommend).
- Each Git commit must have a descriptive message that explains the changes.
- Each Git commit must have a sign off (git commit --signoff).
- Each Git commit message must start with either:
  - `feat: ...` for features
  - `fix: ...` for bug and security fixes
  - `refactor: ...` for code refactorings
  - `docs: ...` for documentation changes
  - `chore: ...` for changes not related to source code
  - `revert: ...` for reverting a previous commit

Mandatory check before creating a pull request: `task check`
