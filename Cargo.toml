Cubic is a lightweight command line manager for virtual machines. It has a
simple, daemon-less and rootless design. All Cubic virtual machines run
isolated in the user context. Cubic is built on top of QEMU, KVM and cloud-init.

$ cubic image ls

Create a new virtual machine instance:
$ cubic add mymachine --image ubuntu:noble

List all virtual machine instances:
$ cubic ls

Start an instance:
$ cubic start <instance name>

Stop an instance:
$ cubic stop <instance name>

Open a shell in the instance:
$ cubic ssh <machine name>

Copy a file from the host to the instance:
$ cubic scp <path/to/host/file> <machine>:<path/to/guest/file>

Copy a file from the instance to the hots:
$ cubic scp <machine>:<path/to/guest/file> <path/to/host/file>
